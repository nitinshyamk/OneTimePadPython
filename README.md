OneTimePadPython
================

a simple set of files that convert a string to a cipher text using the one time pad.
NOT intended to be secure yet, simply an exercise in converting character strings
to bit strings using the  xor operation. I will attempt to add a more secure pseudo random
generator later (though implemented, linear congruential generator was not used because of 
poor security, decided to simply wait to implement a more secure PRG).
